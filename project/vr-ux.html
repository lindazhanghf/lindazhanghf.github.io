                        During the second half of my internship at Moxie, I worked on this VR game that is designed to fill the gap of VR games in Twitch streaming. Using a giant retro-style chat window, the players are able to see their Twitch audience's response without taking off their headset.

                    <h2>10 Usability Heuristics should be carefully evaluated</h2>
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>Ever felt lost in a VR game? I certainly have. More than once have I started the VR experience standing in a dark room or some fancy sci-fi space, looking around and still not a clue of what to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When users move from 2D screens to 3D immersives, the interface is no longer familiar to them. Since VR is still a relatively new medium, there are less conventions in user experience design across applications. Luckily, the 10 Usability Heuristics can still applied here and I found them to be highly valuable when developing the VR game during my internship.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <h3><b>Visibility of System Status</b></h3>
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>
                    VR doesn’t have a standard of way of displaying system status, like breadcrumbs in web design or tab bars in mobile app design. There’s no “status bar” to place information in a 3D world.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I found this problem when I first play-tested our VR game. Before each round begins, there is a 24 seconds voting period where the player is waiting for the Twitch audience to vote on level difficulty. There is no countdown clock or any other method to show the progress, leaving the player confused and sometimes bored. This is caused by not displaying the current system status.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I explored different ways to solve this problem and ended up <b>using audio prompts</b>. Since our game already have a “virtual host” that guides the player through the game and makes random commentaries, we decided to go with the same theme. We asked the voice actor of the “virtual host” to record some short audio clips explaining the current voting status to the player. In addition to <b>informing the player that audience is voting on the upcoming level</b>, the host will also entertain the player by commenting on the voting process.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row" style="color:black; margin-top: 1em ">
                    <h3><b>User Control and Freedom</b></h3>
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>
                    There isn’t a convenient place to put the “X” Exit button in VR, nor a Back button. In many VR applications, once you’ve selected an option, you just had to go with it or restart the experience.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    When play-testing our VR game, I noticed that there is no way to exit out of the game or to open up the main menu. Both the trigger and the trackpad button on Vive controller is occupied by game controls, so there is no where else to put the main menu button.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    After discussing with the designer aout this issue, we decided to keep the way it is, since “this game is basically to troll you.” However, we added an audio prompt to inform players that they can <b>return to main menu</b> by “killing themselves in the game.”
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="row" style="margin-top: 1em">
                    <h3><b>Error Prevention</b></h3>
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>
                    In my own experience, the precision of “pull trigger to select” on the controller is lower than “click to select” using a mouse on a computer screen. Sometimes when my controller is pointing at one option, after I pull the trigger causing a slight muscle movement, my controller is shifted downwards and I ended up selecting the option underneath it.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    A common way of solving this issue in VR is to change the action from clicking to holding/hovering for a short period of time. This eliminates most error-prone conditions such that the player is simply looking around or grabbing the virtual objects around them. This is implemented in our game: when the players want to identify the save tile, they need to <b>hold the trackpad button for 3 seconds to confirm</b>.

                    <!-- <br/>
                    <br/> -->
                    <!-- Here I am proposing another solution to this problem: <b>register the “click” event when the player <i>starts</i> to pull the trigger</b>, not when the trigger button is released. This way it eliminates the possible controller movement that could cause by clicking or squeezing the controller. -->
                    </p>

                    <h3>Other Usability Heuristics</h3>
                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>The above three usability heuristics are the ones that I found the most useful when evaluating the user experience in VR. Other heuristics are applicable to VR as well, such as "Aesthetic and minimalist design" which is even more important in VR than 2D design space, since the virtual space can feel cluttered real quick as more information are added.

                            VR user interface is still pretty much a blank canvas waiting to be explored. Some VR applications basically move UI for 2D screens into VR; some others might have traditional interfaces such as keyboard in the the game, etc. The most common approaches right now is to use controllers as laser pointers and aim at a 2D UI to select, with additional track pad control for scrolling through pages.
                        </p>
                        <!-- <b>Avoid: using 2D UI</b>
                        <p>
                        2D screens, interactions without laser pointers, traditional user interfaces such as keyboard typing, scroll bar, etc.

                        <br/><b>Do</b><br/>
                        2D screens with laser pointers; use trackpad to scroll, but less sensitive (one screen per swipe).
                        <br/> -->
                        <p>
                            Through researching and playing VR applications, I found these solutions that are well designed and very effective for VR.
                            <!-- They are really helpful for me to design UI for my master's project VR game, so I summarize them to 3 main categories. -->

                    <div class="col-md-12">
                        <p>
                        Instead of aiming with a laser and pressing the trigger button to interact with UI, make 2D UI into 3D objects so that the user can directly interact with it. 3D objects also blend in with the virtual environment better.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Buttons with depth and thickness feels more immersive</li>

                        </ul>
                        In VR Barista Training, the step labels are really thin plates that will physically rotate to display the check mark at the back:

                            Let's move away from UIs, and focus on how we can modify our controller to make itself an interface. The best example would be the menu in Tilt Brush.

                        <p>Tilt Brush, one of the controller becomes an interface. It's a cube with four faces displaying different menu options. The user can go through the menu, simply by rotating their wrist.</p>

                        <p>Another way is modifying the controller's shape to extend its functionality. In Daydream Lab's prototype of the "Drum Keyboard", the controller becomes a drumstick that can collide with the drum keys. This way the user can type on the keyboard without their virtual fingers or the controller model blocking their view.
                        <!-- It also avoids problem where user's virtual hands miss-match with their real hands in size and finger position. -->

                            A universal, natural user interface would ease the learning curve of jumping into new VR applications and help more users to adopt VR. Thus I am proposing a generalized gesture-based interface that can be to guide user experiences design in VR.

                        Unlike other mediums, the immersiveness of virtual reality gives users the most unique experience, but at the same time magnifies the tiniest glitches and inconsistencies. Your game could look perfectly fine in the Unity3D window, but once you put on that headset, the bugs become a lot noticeable simple because “it doesn’t feel right.”
                        <br/><br/>
                        During my development experience, I found that small problems within these areas tend to be ignored by our developers, which could make the game feels unfinished:
                    <ol>
                        <li> Color inconsistency in 2D interface as well as 3D objects</li>
                        <li> Changes in the peripheral vision</li>
                        <li> Audio not syncing with visual</li>
                        <li> Inconsistency in volume level </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another area that could potentially break the game is: <b>throwing things in VR</b>. It's no secret that players all love to throw random things around in VR, but it could cause hidden problems as well. Take the following problem I encoutered during VR game development as an example:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is possible for players to throw batteries (the key to solve the puzzle) onto certain places where is <b>unreachable by the player</b> and get stuck. Since the batteries doesn't respawn unless they hit the bottom of the game board, that round becomes unsolvable. I used a simple solution without changing much in the game: <b>make the surfaces slippery</b> for the batteries, so they will not stay on those surfaces, and <b>always fall along the sides</b> and eventually get respawned.
